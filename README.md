### **SignifyMe**  

SignifyMe is an innovative AI-powered mobile application that bridges communication gaps between deaf and hearing communities. This **Flutter-based** app captures **sign language gestures** via the device camera and translates them into **text or speech in real-time** while also providing the reverse functionality.  

Our system leverages a **custom-trained neural network** on thousands of sign language samples to recognize **hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements** with high accuracy. Initially supporting **American Sign Language (ASL)**, we aim to expand to other sign languages worldwide.
